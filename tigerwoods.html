            <p>Tiger Woods, born Eldrick Tont Woods on December 30, 1975, is the greatest American professional golfer. He is tied for first in PGA Tour wins, ranks second in men's major championships, and holds numerous golf records. Woods is widely regarded as one of the greatest athletes of all time and one of the most famous of the 21st century.</p>

            <h2>Career Highlights</h2>
            <p>Tiger Woods turned professional in 1996 at the age of 20, and by April 1997 had already won his first major, the Masters, in a record-breaking performance. He reached the number one position in the world rankings for the first time in June 1997, less than a year after turning pro. 22 years later he did the impossible by winning the Masters again, giving him his 15th Major Championship. Throughout his career, Woods has broken numerous golf records and was the dominant force in golf for many years. He completely transcended the sport and created popularity in a place where it hadn't previously been. He didn't miss a cut at a professional tournament for 142 consecutive events. We truly have never seen anything quite like Tiger and will probably never see it again.</p>
